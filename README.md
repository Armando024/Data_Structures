# Data_Structures
Show casing my data structures in C++


## Some implemetations i made in C++. All written from scratch.
   ### Stack:LIFO (Last in,First out) 
       Implemented in Dynamic Array and Linked List.  
   ### Queue:
       Basic Data Structure: FIFO, First in First Out.     
   ### Priority Queue:
       Basic Data Structure:Similar as above. However, it gives priority to the input values with higher weight. 
   ### Linked List:
       Implemeted a Linked List with the describe implemetations in the top of the main.cpp file
